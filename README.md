# HierarchicalClustering_Prac

This is an Unsupervised Classification method because there are no prior 
classification/response variable associated with the data visual technique.

We are using a hierarchical cluster analysis to obtain a working clustering of the 
cnbc states data.

We then used hierarchical cluster analysis to segment the car market by brand using 
the MT Cars dataset.
