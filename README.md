# HierarchicalClustering_Prac

This is an unsupervised classification method because there are no prior classification/response variable 
associated with the data visual technique.

In the first section of this project, I'm using a hierarchical cluster analysis to obtain a working clustering 
of the cnbc states data from 2021. In the second section, I'm using the technique to segment the car market by brand 
using the MT Cars dataset.
